## 📊 Lineup Data Disclaimer

Lineup data is based on publicly available information at the time of import.  
Artist appearances, stages, or schedules may change at any time.

This app does **not** guarantee completeness or real-time updates.  
Always verify final schedules on the official Tomorrowland website.

## 🔐 Privacy Philosophy

This project is built with a **privacy-first mindset**:

* ❌ No user accounts
* ❌ No analytics / tracking
* ❌ No cookies
* ❌ No external data storage
* ✅ All ratings and favorites stored **locally on your device** (IndexedDB)

You are fully in control of your data.

**Note:**  
The app is hosted on GitHub Pages. Like any web hosting provider, basic server logs  
(e.g. IP address, request time) may be generated by the hosting platform itself.  
The application does not access, process, or analyze these logs.

---

## 🚀 Deployment

The app is designed for **static hosting** and works out of the box on:

* GitHub Pages
* Any static web server

No build step required.

## Manual Smoke Checks

Use these quick checks after changes (especially Service Worker updates):

1) Online load
   - App loads without console errors.
   - Snapshot dropdown populates.

2) Offline fallback
   - Open the app once, then go offline and refresh.
   - Shell loads and last visited content is available.

3) Update flow
   - Deploy a change.
   - Open the app again and confirm the "Update available" banner appears.
   - Click "Reload" to apply the update.
